									<h2><a href="dives.html">Gale Reef</a></h2>
									<p>
										This is a dive site best accessible from Colombo and Mount Lavina. Gale Reef South is flat ground site with rows and rows of Gorgonian Fans. Dharshana Jayawardena says, ‘never before have laid eyes on such a vast profusion of small and large Gorgonian Fans anywhere in Sri Lanka’. Strong currents is expected. And rapid head down descent may required. Our dive master does not use anchors on this site. Redtooth Triggerfish are spotted.									</p>

									<h2><a href="dives.html">Claire’s REEF</a></h2>
									<p>
										We had an amazing time doing the 2 day/1 night sailing trip with Coral Sea! The crew was amazing and fun. The dive/snorkel sites were fantastic. I even did my first night dive which was a wonder in itself. We saw turtles, rays, sharks, and fish galore.

										The Great Barrier Reef is a Wonder for a reason and Coral Sea made our time out there amazing. The food was good and the boat was cool. They supply you with everything you need.
										
										Even if you don’t dive, you will see a lot snorkeling. However, if you are interest in diving but haven’t been certified, don’t worry, they take first-timers a lot and make it very comfortable.									</p>
